# jiggajigga_nuggets
2018-2019 Jigga Jigga competition game controller, made by me.

Jigga Jigga is a competition local to Proof School where teams create AIs (i.e. functions in Python) to play a game.
I created the game for this year, called Nuggets (but not the graphics). The rules are described in the file "Jigga Jigga Game Mechanics.txt".
